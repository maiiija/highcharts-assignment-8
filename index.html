    <p>The U.S. has had a gender pay gap between men and women for a very long time. According to 2022 data collected by <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2023/03/01/gender-pay-gap-facts/">Pew Research Center</a>, women, on average, earn 82% of what men earn. Less discussed is the fact that this gap occurs across both gender and race.</p>

<p>As shown in the graph, both Asian-American men and women take the lead in median earnings, but have the largest gendered wage gap overall.  White Americans are slightly behind, but the gendered gap is slightly less significant. Though Black Americans had a much wider pay gap, their gender gap is the lowest. Hispanic or Latino Americans had the lowest median earnings.</p>

<p>Between September 2023 and September 2024, unemployment was lowest in January. It climbed until July, where it hit its peak, with about 1,000 more people unemployed than at the beginning of the year. Unemployment started to drop again in August, continuing through September.</p>
